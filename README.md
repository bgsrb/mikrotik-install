# Auto Install CHR Mikrotik on VPS

## How to Use

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgsrb/mikrotik-install/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

shutdown manually from vps ui, then turn on it

### Caution !!!
I already test anything to set password on boot, but it can't. so after vps turn on, you must be change the password and user. otherwise you know what will happen :)
